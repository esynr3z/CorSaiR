Corsair is a tool that makes it easy to organize and support control and status register (CSR) map for an any FPGA/ASIC project.
You just need to create and fill single CSR map description file once and then generate HDL code, headers, documentation and etc.

Instal the latest stable version from pypi:

::

    python3 -m pip install -U corsair

Architecture of the tool is quite straightforfard and follows the "one to many" principle. So that you need to support only the one input file to generate unlimited number of output artifacts. This effectively eliminates any syncroniztion issues between outputs, e.g. documentation and HDL code will always match each other since the only one common source is used.
