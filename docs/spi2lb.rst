=======================
SPI to Local Bus bridge
=======================

Special bridge that can be useful for some core-less projects.
Just put all the design's control and status information into a register map, add this bridge and rule your FPGA from PC / MCU / other FPGA.

Example of a such design can be found in the main `repository <https://github.com/esynr3z/corsair/tree/master/corsair/examples/spi_regs>`_.

.. note::

    Specific bit widths for buses are defined in configuration section of a CSR map description file.

Parameters
==========

Some generic SPI parameters:

* SPI slave
* mode 0 only:
    * clock polarity - low in idle state
    * clock phase - data sampled on rising edge and shifted out on the falling edge
* most significant bit (MSB) is transmitted first
* byte order from high to low
* ``spi_sck`` frequency must at least 8 times lower than ``clk`` frequency

Parameters related to code generation:

* Set ``lb_bridge.type`` parameter to  ``"spi"`` to select this bridge
* Address width is controlled with ``address_width`` parameter
* Data width is controlled with ``data_width`` parameter
* Python drivers (`pyftdi <https://pypi.org/project/pyftdi/>`_-based) generation can be enabled with ``lb_bridge.py_driver`` being set to ``true``

Transfers
=========

Just for example, data is 16 bits wide and address is 8 bits wide.

Write
-----

* Write 16-bit data ``D15-D0`` to 8-bit address ``A7-A0``.
* Control byte MSB is 1 (write opeartion).
* ``WB1``, ``WB0`` - write byte strobes (being set to 1 to write all the bytes).

        {"name": "LocalBus", "wave": "x..........................2..", "data": ["Write"]}
    ]}

Write transaction on LocalBus starts right after last data bit is received and should be ended before next SPI transfer.
There is no back-pressure mechanisms in SPI, so possible collisions should be prevented by proper system design.

Read
----

* Read 16-bit data ``D15-D0`` from 8-bit address ``A7-A0``.
* Control byte MSB is 0 (read opeartion).
* ``WB1``, ``WB0`` - write byte strobes are always set to 0 when read is performing.

Read transaction on LocalBus starts right after MSB of control byte is received and should be ended before data to be transmitted to ``spi_miso``.
